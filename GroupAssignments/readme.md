## Introduction of your research question
With the understanding that parks and recreational spaces are important to all communities, we are interested in exploring how access to these facilities may differ depending on median household income levels. Additionally, if we have the capacity, we would like to explore how the investment and/or creation of parks affect the respective neighborhoodâ€™s housing prices over the span of 10 years, from 2010 to 2020. 
Our research question, **what is the varying spatial distribution of parks to neighborhoods of varying income levels? 

## An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
This project is important to us because we value equal access to parks and recreational spaces, and we believe the creation and investment into these amenities should not contribute to displacement of existing residences. Access to parks and recreational facilities contribute to better living conditions such as increased physical and mental wellness, decreased median temperatures, increased stormwater capture and management, and increased aesthetic value to neighborhoods. As the threat of climate change creates more extreme heat events, many communities seek refuge at local outdoor parks because of shaded infrastructure and decreased temperatures due to green infrastructure. The importance of parks and outdoor recreational spaces became increasingly apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic as communities utilized parks for physical activity and a space to safely socialize with families and friends.

## A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
We are focusing on the City of Los Angeles because of the large spatial area that the city covers as well as the known income disparities within the City of Los Angeles. We are also focusing on the City of Los Angeles due to data constraints and available park equity data. 

## A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
* Housing prices (Federal Housing Finance Agency)
  * [House Price Index Datasets | Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx)
* Median Household Income 
  * Report: [Income and Poverty in the United States: 2020](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.html)
* Parks/Recreation
  * [Trust for Public Land - Los Angeles Data](https://www.tpl.org/city/los-angeles-california)
  * [Trust for Public Land - Shapefile Download for Park Equity Measurement ](https://www.tpl.org/parkserve/downloads )

## A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
We will compare the spatial distribution of parks to neighborhoods of varying income levels. The Trust for Public Land has data on park access across the City of Los Angeles which we will then compare to household characteristics such as median housing prices and income from the Census Bureau and FHFA to determine if wealthier neighborhoods have better access to outdoor park spaces. We also know that green gentrification can occur when low income communities receive investments like park amenities. We are concerned with how providing funding for parks can lead to increasing housing prices and displacement in communities over time. 

## A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research
We expect to understand how income inequality affects investment in Los Angeles communities through their access to outdoor parks and recreational spaces. We expect to see that communities with higher incomes and higher median housing prices have better access to parks and have better quality parks than communities with lower incomes and lower median housing prices. If we are able to find park data over time, we also hope to gain insight into how increased park spaces may lead to displacement of low income residents through gentrification and increased housing prices.
